## Installation

Adldap2 has moved to a composer based installation. If you'd like to use Adldap without an auto-loader, you'll
have to require the files inside the project `src/` directory yourself.

Insert Adldap into your `composer.json` file:

    "adldap2/adldap2": "5.2.*"
   
Run `composer update`
